The AI Purity Scale is a framework for transparently communicating how much artificial intelligence (AI) assistance was used in a project, document, or artwork. This system introduces standardized badges‚Äîsimilar to GitHub shields‚Äîto provide a quick and clear summary of AI vs. human contributions.

---

## üöÄ Purpose

As AI tools become prevalent in coding, writing, and creative processes, it‚Äôs crucial to establish an honest and ethical framework for their use. The AI Purity Scale is designed to:
	
 	‚Ä¢	Promote transparency about AI involvement.
 	‚Ä¢	Prevent stigmatization of AI use while encouraging ethical practices.
 	‚Ä¢	Help educators, researchers, and developers evaluate contributions.

---

## üé® The AI Purity Scale

The AI Purity Scale measures contributions across a sliding range, using color-coded badges:

Scale |	Description |Color |Badge Example |
|-----|-------------|------|--------------|
Purely Human | Fully human-created | Blue | ![Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/AI_Purity-Purely_Human-blue)	
Mostly Human | Minor AI assistance | Light Blue | ![Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/AI_Purity-Mostly_Human-lightblue)
Mixed Collab | Equal AI and human input | Yellow | ![Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/AI_Purity-Mixed_Colab.-yellow)	
Mostly AI | Significant AI use | Orange	| ![Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/AI_Purity-Mostly_AI-orange)
Purely AI | Fully AI-generated | Red | ![Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/AI_Purity-Purely_AI-red)
	
---

## üõ† Category-Specific Badges

In addition to the overall scale, badges can identify specific types of AI assistance:

Category| Badge Example|
|-------|--------------|
Spelling and Grammar (SPGR) | ![SPGR](https://img.shields.io/badge/AI_Assist-üìù_Spelling_%26_Grammar-yellow)

## üß© How to Use AI Purity Badges

1. ## Add a Badge to Your Project

To include a badge in your README file or project page, use the following Markdown syntax:

```md
![Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/AI_Purity-<MESSAGE>-<COLOR>)
```

Replace:

	‚Ä¢	<MESSAGE> with the text (e.g., 50% AI, 50% Human).
	‚Ä¢	<COLOR> with the appropriate color (e.g., yellow).

Example:

```html
![Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/AI_Purity-Mostly_Human-lightblue)
```
Result: ![Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/AI_Purity-Mostly_Human-lightblue)

2. ### Combine Badges for Specific AI Contributions

You can use multiple badges to show AI involvement in specific areas. For example:

Example Assessment

If you describe your project as:

‚ÄúI used ChatGPT to generate the structure for my essay (Outline Assistance) and asked it to clean up spelling and grammar errors (Spelling and Grammar). I wrote all the content myself.‚Äù

AI Purity Score: Mostly Human (75-90% human)

Reasoning:
	‚Ä¢	AI was used for Outline Assistance and Spelling/Grammar corrections, but the content itself was human-written. The core creative work remains primarily human-driven, with AI playing a supporting role.

---

### Why This Matters

The AI Purity Score helps communicate how much of your work was influenced by AI tools. It promotes transparency, encourages ethical use of AI, and gives credit where it‚Äôs due‚Äîboth to human effort and AI assistance.

By including an AI Purity Score in your work, you ensure clarity and honesty in your process. üöÄ
