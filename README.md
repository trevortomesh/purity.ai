üìä AI Purity Scale

The AI Purity Scale is a framework for transparently communicating how much artificial intelligence (AI) assistance was used in a project, document, or artwork. This system introduces standardized badges‚Äîsimilar to GitHub shields‚Äîto provide a quick and clear summary of AI vs. human contributions.

üöÄ Purpose

As AI tools become prevalent in coding, writing, and creative processes, it‚Äôs crucial to establish an honest and ethical framework for their use. The AI Purity Scale is designed to:
	‚Ä¢	Promote transparency about AI involvement.
	‚Ä¢	Prevent stigmatization of AI use while encouraging ethical practices.
	‚Ä¢	Help educators, researchers, and developers evaluate contributions.

üé® The AI Purity Scale

The AI Purity Scale measures contributions across a sliding range, using color-coded badges:

Scale	Description	Color	Badge Example
100% Human	Fully human-created	Blue	
Mostly Human	Minor AI assistance	Light Blue	
50/50	Equal AI and human input	Yellow	
Mostly AI	Significant AI use	Orange	
100% AI	Fully AI-generated	Red	

üõ† Category-Specific Badges

In addition to the overall scale, badges can identify specific types of AI assistance:

Category	Badge Example
Spelling and Grammar (SPGR)	
Code Comments (CMT)	
Outline Assistance (OUT)	
Logic Generation (LOG)	
Documentation (DOC)	

You can combine these badges to show multiple forms of AI use.

üß© How to Use AI Purity Badges

1. Add a Badge to Your Project

To include a badge in your README file or project page, use the following Markdown syntax:

![Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/AI_Purity-<MESSAGE>-<COLOR>)

Replace:
	‚Ä¢	<MESSAGE> with the text (e.g., 50% AI, 50% Human).
	‚Ä¢	<COLOR> with the appropriate color (e.g., yellow).

Example:

![Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/AI_Purity-Mostly_Human-lightblue)

Result:

2. Combine Badges for Specific AI Contributions

You can use multiple badges to show AI involvement in specific areas. For example:

![Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/AI_Purity-Mostly_Human-lightblue)
![Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/AI_Assist-Logic_Generation-orange)
![Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/AI_Assist-Code_Comments-lightgreen)

Result:

üìú Why Transparency Matters
	1.	Honesty: Clearly showing AI involvement builds trust with your audience.
	2.	Education: Teachers and students can better evaluate learning outcomes.
	3.	Ethics: Reduces the stigma around AI tools while promoting responsible use.
	4.	Recognition: Differentiates human contributions from AI assistance, giving proper credit.

üåê Future Directions

This framework can be expanded with:
	‚Ä¢	Automated tools for measuring AI involvement.
	‚Ä¢	AI contribution reports linking specific badges to project summaries.
	‚Ä¢	Formal standards for academic and industry use.
