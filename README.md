The AI Purity Scale is a framework for transparently communicating how much artificial intelligence (AI) assistance was used in a project, document, or artwork. This system introduces standardized badges—similar to GitHub shields—to provide a quick and clear summary of AI vs. human contributions.

---

🚀 Purpose

As AI tools become prevalent in coding, writing, and creative processes, it’s crucial to establish an honest and ethical framework for their use. The AI Purity Scale is designed to:
	
 	•	Promote transparency about AI involvement.
	•	Prevent stigmatization of AI use while encouraging ethical practices.
	•	Help educators, researchers, and developers evaluate contributions.

🎨 The AI Purity Scale

The AI Purity Scale measures contributions across a sliding range, using color-coded badges:

Scale |	Description |Color |Badge Example |
|-----|-------------|------|--------------|
Purely Human | Fully human-created | Blue | ![Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/AI_Purity-Purely_Human-blue)	
Mostly Human | Minor AI assistance | Light Blue | ![Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/AI_Purity-Mostly_Human-lightblue)
Mixed Collab | Equal AI and human input | Yellow | ![Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/AI_Purity-Mixed_Colab.-yellow)	
Mostly AI | Significant AI use | Orange	| ![Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/AI_Purity-Mostly_AI-orange)
Purely AI | Fully AI-generated | Red | ![Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/AI_Purity-Purely_AI-red)
	
---

🛠 Category-Specific Badges

In addition to the overall scale, badges can identify specific types of AI assistance:

Category| Badge Example|
|-------|--------------|
Spelling and Grammar (SPGR) | ![SPGR](https://img.shields.io/badge/AI_Assist-📝_Spelling_%26_Grammar-yellow)
Code Comments (CMT) | ![CMT](https://img.shields.io/badge/AI_Assist-💬_Code_Comments-lightgreen)
Outline Assistance (OUT) | ![OUT](https://img.shields.io/badge/AI_Assist-📄_Outline_Assistance-blue)
Logic Generation (LOG) | ![LOG](https://img.shields.io/badge/AI_Assist-⚙️_Logic_Generation-orange)
Documentation (DOC) | ![DOC](https://img.shields.io/badge/AI_Assist-📑_Documentation-red)

You can combine these badges to show multiple forms of AI use.

🧩 How to Use AI Purity Badges

1. Add a Badge to Your Project

To include a badge in your README file or project page, use the following Markdown syntax:

```md
![Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/AI_Purity-<MESSAGE>-<COLOR>)
```

Replace:

	•	<MESSAGE> with the text (e.g., 50% AI, 50% Human).
	•	<COLOR> with the appropriate color (e.g., yellow).

Example:

```html
![Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/AI_Purity-Mostly_Human-lightblue)
```
Result: ![Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/AI_Purity-Mostly_Human-lightblue)

2. Combine Badges for Specific AI Contributions

You can use multiple badges to show AI involvement in specific areas. For example:

![SPGR](https://img.shields.io/badge/AI_Assist-📝_Spelling_%26_Grammar-yellow)
![CMT](https://img.shields.io/badge/AI_Assist-💬_Code_Comments-lightgreen)
![OUT](https://img.shields.io/badge/AI_Assist-📄_Outline_Assistance-blue)
![LOG](https://img.shields.io/badge/AI_Assist-⚙️_Logic_Generation-orange)
![DOC](https://img.shields.io/badge/AI_Assist-📑_Documentation-red)

📜 Why Transparency Matters

	1.	Honesty: Clearly showing AI involvement builds trust with your audience.
	2.	Education: Teachers and students can better evaluate learning outcomes.
	3.	Ethics: Reduces the stigma around AI tools while promoting responsible use.
	4.	Recognition: Differentiates human contributions from AI assistance, giving proper credit.

🌐 Future Directions

This framework can be expanded with:

	•	Automated tools for measuring AI involvement.
	•	AI contribution reports linking specific badges to project summaries.
	•	Formal standards for academic and industry use.
